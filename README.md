Look under the separate folders for modules, including code, workbooks and README instructions:<br>
* <b>StockPerformance</b> - basic charting and intro to Tableau<br>

* TBD #2<br>
 
There is a <b>ton</b> of professional demos produced by Tableau<br>
* You can access this by opening tableau and making a selection under the right-side <b>Training</b> pane<br>
* Here is a good starting point: https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started-visual-analytics <br>
* Note: you may be asked to sign in to access the training if you haven't activated your version<br>


# Beyond Tableau:<br>
* Graphs (social networks, etc.)<br>
* Real-time dashboards<br>
* Machine-learning friendly graphs with <b>R</b><br>
  The R programming language is a nice complement to displaying machine-learning<br>
  There is a quick-start guide by Microsoft attached to this repo's top level<br>
